## Development

sidekiq-workflow is being developed in tandom with a series of tutorials on the process of [developing a rails gem](https://badmonkeydev.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/how-to-build-your-own-ruby-gem-from-start-to-finish/).  Feel free to follow along or to use the series as a means of coming up to speed on the code.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
